# PB173/oss: Open Source Development Course

The main goal of the course is to help and encourage university students to join the development of real-world open-source software. The course consists of 4--5 hosted lectures by senior developers, two small homework assignments and quite a bit of open-source development. We closely cooperate with [Red Hat Open Source Contest](https://research.redhat.com/red-hat-open-source-contest/).

## Course requirements

In order to pass the course, the student must:

* **Contribute to an existing open-source project in scope of 50-60 hours.**  
The student chooses the open-source project for contribution themself, but this selection must be approved by the teachers till 29th September. Tasks from the [Red Hat Open Source Contest](https://research.redhat.com/red-hat-open-source-contest/) are pre-approved. If you choose elsewhere, look for known active projects that you are not yet part of.
* **Track time spent on the project.**  
It is beneficial to develop such a habbit for further contract work the student could have later.
* **Hand in two compulsory homework assignments.**  
These will cover git, CI/CD systems, pull requests and basic developer best practices. An approximate description of tasks can be found in the file [assignments.md](assignments.md).
* **Deliver three short presentation (10 minutes talks) about your work.**  
This will be the initial work planning, mid-term progress update and final presentation at the end.
* **(optionally) Attend lectures on open source development**  
The lectures provided are not compulsory but are highly reccommended.
